# Optimization Plan for Ohio State Students

### Linear programming project by Josh DeKeersgieter and Eddie Kubit

---

This application will prompt a student for their current balances of meal plan currencies (swipes, dining dollars, BuckID cash) and optimize the spending of those currencies to make sure there is minimal unused balance.

The GUROBI solver is required to run this optimization.Once that has been installed the user can interact with the application at the command line and see their suggested spending.

Menus and corresponding prices were sourced from the Grubhub student dining app for most on-campus restaurants and coffee shops.
